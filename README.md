In this project, I use a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. Here you can find the code to:

    Section 1:
        Create a table to store animals' information,
        Insert some data into it, and query it.
    Section 2:
        Use transactions to update and delete records.
        Use aggregate functions and GROUP BY to answer analytical questions.
    Section 3:
        Add some new tables.
        Add foreign key columns to the existing animals' table to model one-to-many relationships.
        Use JOIN to query the data.
    Section 4:
        Add some many-to-many relationships.
        Write more complex queries to use them to answer questions.



## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## Built With

    - Relational Database PostgreSQL
    - Visual Studio Code
